And they even bring their own stats on what we stand to lose if we don’t change!</br></br>So a postmortem is a neat little package argument for doing the repair items it suggests. Don’t squander this opportunity on repair items that just paper over problems. Really dig in - you’ve been given a window into how your system functions (and mis-functions), which you can use to revisit prior architecture decisions and inform your future design. Take advantage of the data that’s fallen into your lap! Champion incisive change, one repair item at a time!",
