My team at Twitter found themselves in this situation.  The services had scaled by an order of magnitude in two years and were generating hundreds of alerts per quarter. Over the course of a quarter I led an initiative to decrease the number of alerts, improve the experience of being on call, and increase the reliability of the services.  These efforts were incredibly successful reducing the number of critical alerts by 50%.  In this talk I’ll discuss the process and alerting best practices we’ve put in places to successfully combat alert fatigue and avoid over alerting in the future.",

    "abstract": "At a conference like Monitorama, it’s bewildering to hear that companies do not have ways to measure how their systems are performing. Yet, this is the norm. In our current economic climate, the argument to spend time instrumenting code and tooling seems counter-productive, and is often assigned the same priority that is placed on documentation (last, if at all).<br /><br />A vast number of reasons exist for why companies are *not* leveraging instrumentation, and inertia and lack of understanding only perpetuates this problem. In this talk, we will not spend time talking about an ideal infrastructure. Rather, we’ll spend time talking about how and why metrics implementations fail in the first place, and discuss some ways that you can overcome and find ultimate harmony within IT.",
